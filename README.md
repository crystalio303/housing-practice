### King County Washington State Housing 

This is practice using Python for Exploratory Data Analysis. I worked on houses with waterfront  or view of water.

There is a lot of water in the area yet the points are not directly on the water.

Pearson correlation in regards to the waterfront column. I think that price decreases with possibility of waterfront because not many houses have waterfront. There are plenty of expensive houses without waterfront.

Graph of price without and with waterfront. 1 means with waterfront and 0 is without waterfront.

What was view? Other people thought it was number of views a house looked out onto or how many page clicks a house got for viewing. The Kaggle source for the dataset did not include a data dictionary and multiple ones were found fron other people's work. I think that the first guess is right so that houses that have windows with water, woods, or other natural beauty are regarded as rooms with a view since the number of them increases with the count of that with waterfront.

Not as many houses built with waterfront from 1980 to 2000 when there was an increase in houses being built.

I was interested in waterfront with an unexplored part in views whose environment focus was relevant my interest. When looking up trends, someone told me that feature engineering would help explain dual trends such as more expensive or less expensive properties with waterfront.
